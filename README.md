# Polyth-Net-Classification-of-Polythene-Bags-Using-Deep-Dearning
Backend work for the research publication titled - Polyth-Net: Classification of Polythene Bags Using Deep Dearning

This project aims to classify polythene bags efficiently from other garbage materials to abolish and minmize the human labour
as this job is very hazardous to the healths of humans working on these segregation tasks
The classes are as follows
0:non-plastic
1:plastic but not polythene
2:polythene bag
The model uses an Xception network combined with data augmentation from keras to produce astonishing results on test data
